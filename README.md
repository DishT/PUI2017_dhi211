# WELCOME TO MY REPO!! (PUI2017_dhi211)
Welcome to my README.md for the repo PUI2017_dhi211

In here is a folder with information related to HW1

FYI I added the README.md file from HW1_dhi211 because I was unclear about the format you wanted this to be saved in. 
I do not think you want me to put this here, but I'm doing so to cover my bases.


# HW1_2
This is the README file for PUI Homework 1, Task 2.
For this assignment I first struggled to create the correct file structure on my machine. I learned how to remove a folder (using the git rn -r <name of folder> command), because I set it up incorrectly at first.
  
As for the assignment, I started by creating the bash_profile using the EMACS editior. See image below:

When working with some co-workers, I realized that I have a few more lines of code in my bash profile. 

Anyways, back to the assignment!
Below you can see that my bash_profile was correctly created:

#HAHA!
 I didn't fully read the instructions(I _apologize_!). The text above was edited on the GitHub remote repository. However, this text was added in my local enviornment via Terminal.

I will not enter the following functions to have it added to GitHub:
git add README.md
git commit -m 'This will be a comment'
git push
