# HW1_2
This is the README file for PUI Homework 1, Task 2.
For this assignment I first struggled to create the correct file structure on my machine. I learned how to remove a folder (using the git rn -r <name of folder> command), because I set it up incorrectly at first.
  
As for the assignment, I started by creating the bash profile using the EMACS editior. See image below:

When working with some co-workers, I realized that I have a few more lines of code in my bash profile. 

Anyways, back to the assignment!
Below you can see that the alias was correctly created:

#HAHA!
 I didn't fully read the instructions(I _apologize_!). The text above was edited on the GitHub remote repository. However, this text was added in my local enviornment via Terminal.

I will not enter the following functions to have it added to GitHub:
git add README.md
git commit -m 'This will be a comment'
git push
