## HW3 Read Me



HW3_1
For this assigment I worked primarily with Imran, with guidance from Valeria, Matt, and Kent.


Once we started plotting the standard means wiht different distributions, Imran and I researched the different variables to enter and how each plot works. 


I used a different distribution for my 5th plot. I used the Wald (or reverse Gaussian).



HW3_2 
I worked with Srikanth and Imran.
For this one I worked by my self to set up the data. However, using the skeleton data did not work so cleanly. Srikanth helped me resolve ways to draw the data into my notebook and walk through the intracacies of the code. We then came up with the hypothesis and null hypothesis.


Srikanth and I could not cleanly extract the data from the reduced dataframe, so Srikanth developed a way to convert that infomroation into lists so that we could easily plot the information.



HW3_3
I worked with Srikanth and Imran.
This third one I looked at the presentation from class. Srikanth made a very clean way of naming the data. I used a similar naming system.


FOR NEXT TIME:
-Figure out how to extract data from .csv as Federica perscribed.
-Add more nomenclature using "#" symbol to be able to follow my past actions better
